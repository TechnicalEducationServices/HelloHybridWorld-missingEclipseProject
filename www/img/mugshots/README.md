Mugshots - Hello Hybrid World!
==============================


Hey Folks,

As mentioned in your lab guides, copy an image that identifies you to this directory.  It can be an image from one of your social network profiles or any other image you'd like.

IMPORTANT:  Use the ID produced for your contact entry in the REST lab as your image filename.  This is the filename that the Contacts mobile app will be looking for when loading your profile.

Throughout the course of the labs, we'll each be:

1. adding our mugshots to our cloned repo (local copy of remote GitHub repo)
2. pushing to our origin repo (remote GitHub repo we cloned)
   
   ... and finally ...

3. merging our efforts to the upstream repo (remote class-shared GitHub repo we forked)

This directory should initially be empty but eventually will contain everyone's work after step #3 above.
